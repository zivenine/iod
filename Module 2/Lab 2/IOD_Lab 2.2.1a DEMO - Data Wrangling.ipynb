On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.\n","\n","> One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\n","\n","In this lab, we'll explore this dataset to find insight.\n","\n","[Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Te9iSnCNVQQv"},"source":["# Data Dictionary\n","\n","| Variable |                                 Definition | Key                                            |\n","|----------|-------------------------------------------:|------------------------------------------------|\n","| Survival | Survival                                   | 0 = No, 1 = Yes                                |\n","| Pclass   | Ticket class                               | 1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd                      |\n","| Sex      | Sex                                        |                                                |\n","| Age      | Age in years                               |                                                |\n","| SibSp    | # of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic |                                                |\n","| Parch    | # of parents / children aboard the Titanic |                                                |\n","| Ticket   | Ticket number                              |                                                |\n","| Fare     | Passenger fare                             |                                                |\n","| Cabin    | Cabin number                               |                                                |\n","| Embarked | Port of Embarkation                        | C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton |"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"8CM9meP1VQQw"},"source":["# Loading Modules"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"GHFxoWnSVQQx"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Load necessary libraries\n","import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","\n","%matplotlib inline"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"XcpBXT93VQQ0"},"source":["# Loading Dataset\n","\n","Read titanic dataset."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"ExecuteTime":{"end_time":"2019-09-30T02:38:12.074784Z","start_time":"2019-09-30T02:38:12.069797Z"},"id":"34iS-SdQVQQ1"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Read Titanic Dataset...
