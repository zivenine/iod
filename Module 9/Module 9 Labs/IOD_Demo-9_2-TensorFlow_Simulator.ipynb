This is a continuation of many people’s previous work — most notably Andrej Karpathy’s [convnet.js demo](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/convnetjs/demo/classify2d.html) and Chris Olah’s [articles](http://colah.github.io/posts/2014-03-NN-Manifolds-Topology/) about neural networks. Many thanks also to D. Sculley for help with the original idea and to Fernanda Viégas and Martin Wattenberg and the rest of the [Big Picture](https://research.google.com/bigpicture/) and [Google Brain](https://research.google.com/teams/brain/) teams for feedback and guidance."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"RERADKgNFq9T"},"source":["\n","\n","---\n","\n","\n","\n","---\n","\n","\n","\n","> > > > > > > > > © 2023 Institute of Data\n","\n","\n","---\n","\n","\n","\n","---\n","\n","\n","\n"]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.8.5"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
