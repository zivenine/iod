Compute the Hadamard product (entry-wise multiplication) of two vectors.\n","\n","> In mathematics, the Hadamard product (also known as the Schur product[1] or the entrywise product[2]:ch. 5) is a binary operation that takes two matrices of the same dimensions and produces another matrix of the same dimension as the operands where each element i, j is the product of elements i, j of the original two matrices. It should not be confused with the more common matrix product. It is attributed to, and named after, either French mathematician Jacques Hadamard or German mathematician Issai Schur.
